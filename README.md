# bot_traffic
**Overview**
Direct good quality traffic to any website. Good for boosting numbers on a website. Uses multithreading + proxies to achieve thousands of visits per hour. (see picture inside this repository for proof)

**Instructions To Run**
This project is very straightforward to setup and run. 

1. Make sure to download the latest version of ChromeDriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and put it in the same directory as traffic.py. 
2. Add proxies to your proxies.txt in the format "ip:port". Each new line will be treated as a new proxy.
3. Configure your username and password for proxies (if any) in the "initdriver" function.
4. Run Traffic.py and follow the input prompts.
5. Enjoy!
